\chapter{BACKGROUND}

This chapter introduces local regression and some time series modeling methods,
with emphasis on a time series decomposition method: seasonal trend decomposition
using loess (STL), and a spatially local regression method. The goal is to be
brief but still cover the methods thoroughly, as much of the new work developed
later depends heavily on these topics.

\section{Local Regression Models}

Often nature presents dependencies that are much more complex than can be captured
with a simple parametric model. When the data suggest that $\mu(x)$ is a complex
function, one may try to accommodate this by specifying a complex parametric model
with many parameters.

Another approach to modeling a complex $\mu$ that is much more simple and flexible
is local regression \cite{Cleveland:1979}. Instead of constraining $\mu(x)$ to 
have a parametric form, assume that the data locally, around some neighborhood of
x, can be well-approximated by a parametric form, namely low order polynomials.

The same idea can be illustrated when replacement of a quantitative variable by
indicator variables

\section{Seasonal Trend Decomposition using Loess (STL)}

Seasonal trend decomposition using loess (STL) is a method for decomposing a time
series into seasonal, trend, and remainder components \cite{Cleveland:1990}.
