\chapter{BACKGROUND}

In this chapter we briefly introduce one type of nonparametric regression method,
namely local polynomial regression method, followed by emphasis on two specific 
generalization of loess as time series decomposition method called Seasonal 
Trend Loess (STL) and Geographically weighted Regression respectively. The main
purpose here is to cover the foundation methodology and principle of the data
analysis proceeded in later chapter, which is crucially depends on these topics.
