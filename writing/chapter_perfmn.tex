\chapter{Multi-factor designed experiment for performance of the 
Nonparametric-Regression Modeling}

In this chapter, we shift our gears to the analysis of the performance of the 
analysis method we proposed in previous chapter for a large spatial temporal data.
There are two groups of tunning parameters for our nonparametric analysis model.
One is the tunning parameters of statistical model, such as smoothing window, 
smoothing degree for both temporal fitting and spatial fitting, which we have
already demonstrated in \cite{} and \cite{} using cross-validation method. Another
group of tunning parameters are user-tunable MapReduce tunning parameters. Within
this chapter, we illustrate a full factorial experiment to study the affect of
these system tunning parameters to the modeling.
