\section{Source of the Data}

The dataset we are going to analyze is a compendium of different levels of 
weather data ranging from stations taking regular hourly measurements, such as 
those at airports, to cooperative observer where the records may only include 
daily values and have gaps in time. Some of original data sources hosted by NCDC 
\cite{NCEI} are shown as follows:

\begin{itemize}
  \item COOP:
    Through the National Weather Service (NWS) Cooperative Observer Program 
    (COOP), more than 10,000 volunteers take daily weather observations at 
    National Parks, seashores, mountaintops, and farms as well as in urban and 
    suburban areas. COOP data usually consist of daily maximum and minimum 
    temperatures \cite{COOP}.
  \item SNOTEL:
    The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) operates and maintains an 
    extensive and automated system (SNOwpack TELemetry or SNOTEL) designed to
    collect snowpack and related climatic data like air temperature in the Western
    United States begins in 1978 \cite{SNOTEL}.
  \item AG:
    Agricultural climate data for southeastern Washington from United States
    Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service (USDA-NRCS) 
    \cite{USDA}.
  \item MRCC:
    Midwest Climate Data Center data, mainly for period between 1895 and 1948. 
    The MRCC \cite{MRCC} serves the nine-state Midwest region (Illinois, Indiana, 
    Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio, and Wisconsin).
  \item USHCN:
    Historical Climate Network data provides summary of the month temperature and 
    precipitation observations for 1,218 stations across the contiguous United 
    States. Temperature observations have been homogeneity corrected to remove 
    biases associated with non-climatic influences, such as changes in 
    instrumentation and observing practices, and changes to the environment 
    including station relocations \cite{USHCN}.
\end{itemize}

In 2002, based on the data set we listed above, the NCDC processed them to a
consolidated and uniform 103-year spatial temporal data set by combining stations 
at similar locations, eliminating stations with short records, and aggregating 
some of daily measurement to be monthly. In summary, the data we are going to 
analyze is about observed monthly average maximum daily temperatures 
for the conterminous US from 1895 to 1997. There are 8,125 stations reporting 
monthly average maximum daily temperatures at some time in this period which 
includes 1,236 months.
