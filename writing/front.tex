It has, without doubt, been a long and difficult journey, and I could not have 
been this far without the help and support of a lot of people.

First of all I would like to express my deeply appreciation and thanks to my 
advisor Dr. William S. Cleveland. I always told myself that I am so luck to get 
such rare opportunity to work with such distinguish professor. Dr. Cleveland 
guided me with his unique thinking, needs for perfect in details, and his 
enthusiasm to research, which indeed profoundly influenced me and will keep 
influencing and benefit me in my future career.

At the same time, I really like to thank the other committee members, Dr.Ryan 
Hafen, Dr. Hao Zhang, and Dr.Mark Daniel Ward. Thank you all for your valuable 
suggestion and unselfish support and help to me during this journey.

Also I would like to give a special thank you to Dr.Mark Daniel Ward, Dr.Sergey
Kirshner, Douglas G. Crabill, and Dr.Rebecca Doerge. Dr.Ward I really do not how 
to express my thank to you for helping me preparing the Qualify Exams. That 
morning in the kitchen of your house discussing probability questions with you 
was a very special and unforgettable moment in my life. You are an wonderful 
professor. Dr.Sergey Kirshner thank you for leading me to the world of 
Computational Statistics in the class of STAT598G. Those sleepless night doing 
project really profoundly stimulated my interests to be a PhD student in the area 
of computational statistics. Doug, thank you for tutoring me with all basic 
knowledge about Hadoop and cluster. And thank you for your time and patience to 
help me with my projects. Sincere thanks to Dr.Rebecca Doerge for all the support 
and encouragement during this six years. You taught me a lot of thing which made 
me to be a better man.

I want to say thank you to my former and present colleagues, Jianfu, Xiang, 
Jiasen, Ashrith, Philip, Aritra, Yuying, Qi, Barret, Jeremy. Jianfu, thank you 
very much for your patience when you unreservedly passed on to me your 
understanding about Hadoop and RHIPE, I cannot be expert on this without your 
teaching. Barret thank you for all your technical support and unselfish help to 
me whenever I said "May I ask you a question" to you. 

I also want to thank all my dear friends at Purdue, who have made my life much 
more enjoyable and memorable. Cheng Liu, thank you for being my mentor since the 
first day I came to Purdue; Cheng and Ximing, thank you for all the fun and 
hangover we have had as roommates in the Lodge; Qiming, thank you for your 
patience and time to help me preparing the talk I gave in the Amazon, and all the
happy hours we shared during our internship over there in that summer; Pan, thank 
you for sharing your knowledge and experience when we were doing project about 
Scala and Spark; Yang, Longjie, Xiaoguang, Hanli, Zhuo, Shuai, Faye, April, 
Kelly-Ann, thank you for being such a great class of 2010; this list keeps going
on, and I thank you all for the happiness you bring to me.

I am very pleased to have an opportunity to spend the last six years in the 
Department of Statistics providing an excellent environment and various 
opportunities. I have learned so much from many faculty and stuff members, as 
well as our excellent graduate students.

Last, but not least, I want to thank my parents, and my beloved wife, for all 
their patience, encouragement, and unconditional love, thank you so much.
