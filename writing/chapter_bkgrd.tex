\chapter{BACKGROUND}

In this chapter, I briefly introduce one type of nonparametric
regression method, namely local polynomial regression method, followed by emphasis 
on two specific generalizations of loess, which are time series decomposition 
method called Seasonal Trend Loess (STL) and Geographically weighted Regression. 
The main purpose here is to cover the foundation methodology and principle of the 
data analysis in later chapter, which crucially depends on these topics. The 
chapter is closed by the introduction of D\&R (Divide and Recombined)
statistical framework. Data can be divided into subsets, each of which is applied
with a statistical analysis method. This is an embarrassing parallel procedure
since there is no communication between each subset. Then the analysis result for
each subset are combined together to be the final analysis outcome for the whole
dataset.
